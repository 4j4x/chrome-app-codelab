Get Ready to Build Chrome Apps!
===============================
Chrome apps are written in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, just like web apps.
But they look and behave more like native apps, and they have super-powerful capabilities,
like the ability to interact with network and hardware devices, media tools, and much more.

Help us make Chrome Apps better!
--------------------------------
Chrome apps are still in developer preview-- we know they aren't perfect. But we're trying to do something new here, bridging together the native and web experience, giving developers choice, and users the best experience possible.

For Chrome apps to succeed, we need and want your feedback, we don't want you to have to go in circles to provide it.
Here's a [very simple feedback form](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1x3309vpp-KTiHqZWOCQhjVrIWxkm0wEBp2IWMG2ywbU/viewform?id=1x3309vpp-KTiHqZWOCQhjVrIWxkm0wEBp2IWMG2ywbU).
